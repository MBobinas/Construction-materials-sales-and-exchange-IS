## Summary

This final project report represents engineered and implemented building materials sales and
exchange information system. The purpose of this project is to allow its users to create
building material listings that other users would see and would be inclined to trade or buy, thus this
way making purchase and exchange processes understandable and effective.

After analyzing the subject area, it was concluded that there is no specialized building materials sales
and exchange information system in Lithuaniaâ€™s market. The processes of the current building
materials sales and exchange community are convoluted and not practical. Thus, it was made clear
that this project is relevant.

After analyzing current technologies, it was concluded that this project will be implemented using
open-source PHP web development framework Laravel and relational database management system
MySQL.

During the system requirement specification period functional and non-functional requirements were
specified. In this stage the following diagrams were created: use case, class entity, logical architecture,
robustness, and project level sequence. Provided graphical user interface prototype, system class
models with descriptions and logical database system scheme were presented.

After system prototype realization there was functional testing during which the project was
thoroughly tested, and it was concluded that created solution meets the specified requirements.

Later this project was defended at Kaunas University of Technology for bachelor's degree and rated highly.
